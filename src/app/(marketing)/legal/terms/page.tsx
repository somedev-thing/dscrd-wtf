        If you use this service to harass people, scam people, or host illegal content, we will ban you.
        We will also probably judge you silently.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">2. No warranty.</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This service is provided "as is". If it breaks, we'll try to fix it. If you lose your custom slug because you forgot to renew it (oh wait, it's a one-time payment), that's on you.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">3. Refunds.</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Since you get instant access to the "Verified" features (custom slugs, themes), we generally don't offer refunds. 
        If something actually broke and you didn't get what you paid for, email us and we'll sort it out.
